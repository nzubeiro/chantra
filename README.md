# Privacy Smart Contract

## Overview
The **Privacy Smart Contract** enables secure storage, access control, and retrieval of encrypted data using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**. It ensures data confidentiality by allowing only authorized users to access encrypted content while keeping an immutable access log.

## Features
- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Users can securely store encrypted data along with a Zero-Knowledge proof.
- **Access Control**: Owners can grant or revoke access permissions.
- **Access Logs**: A transparent logging system records all data access events.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Ensures data integrity using cryptographic proof.

## Data Structures
### Constants
- `contract-owner`: The contract creator.
- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (u100)`: Error for unauthorized access.
- `ERR-INVALID-PROOF (u101)`: Error for invalid proof submission.
- `ERR-INVALID-DATA (u102)`: Error for missing or incorrect data.

### Data Maps
- **encrypted-data**: Stores encrypted content, proof, owner details, and timestamp.
- **access-logs**: Tracks access attempts with timestamps and access types.
- **data-permissions**: Maintains a list of authorized users for each data entry.

## Functions
### Public Functions
#### 1. `store-encrypted-data(data-id, encrypted-content, zk-proof)`
- Stores encrypted data along with a Zero-Knowledge proof.
- Requires a valid proof for successful storage.

#### 2. `grant-access(data-id, user)`
- Grants access to a specific user.
- Only the data owner can execute this function.

#### 3. `access-data(data-id)`
- Allows an authorized user to retrieve encrypted data.
- Logs the access attempt for transparency.

### Read-Only Functions
#### 1. `get-access-logs(data-id)`
- Returns the access logs for a specific data entry.
- Only the data owner can retrieve logs.

#### 2. `has-access(data-id, user)`
- Checks if a specific user has access to the given data.

### Private Functions
#### 1. `is-valid-proof(proof)`
- Placeholder for Zero-Knowledge Proof verification logic.
- Ensures proof validity before data storage.

#### 2. `principal-in-list(user, user-list)`
- Helper function to check if a user exists in an authorized list.

## Security Considerations
- **Data Ownership Enforcement**: Only the original uploader can modify permissions.
- **Immutable Logs**: Every access attempt is permanently recorded.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Ensures authenticity without revealing sensitive details.

## Usage Example
1. **Store Encrypted Data**:
   ```lisp
   (store-encrypted-data u1 0xABCDEF 0x123456)
   ```
2. **Grant Access**:
   ```lisp
   (grant-access u1 'SP1234567890')
   ```
3. **Access Data**:
   ```lisp
   (access-data u1)
   ```

## Conclusion
This contract provides a **privacy-focused** solution for handling encrypted data securely on the blockchain. It ensures **strict access control**, **auditability**, and **confidentiality** using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.
